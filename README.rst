python enteprise integration framework project. Powerfull class library based on EAI patterns and a modeling and simulation tool.


In the last ten years, corporations have grown exponentially in complexity. This has been driven by the increase in sophistication and globalization of theirs markets. This growth has been matched by the growth of their IT infrastructure. The most important element in this growth of enterprise integration needs is the message, its creation, processing, transportation and storage. integrationLabs develops a simple but powerful integration framework to process this fundamental organizational element.

What is the message? The message is the fundamental unit of enterprise communication, it is an order, a trade, an email, a contact, an appointment, a line in a log file, critical system information, a document, it's in fact anything that needs to be communicated. Messages have to be created or extracted, translated, filtered, analyzed, routed, transmitted, stored, and displayed. All these actions form the integration circuitry of an enterprise. integrationLabs is the framework to build these circuit parts and is the tool to do wiring.

What is integrationLabs? It supplies developers with a framework to develop the needed integration circuitry.

    Powerful Simplicity
        With integrationLabs integration, systems are far quicker to develop than with other more heavy and complex products. Because of the elegance and simplicity of its foundation, integration systems built with integrationLabs systems tend to be 3-5 times smaller than their equivalent built with systems such as webMethods. This results in a major reduction of TOC.
        Ilabs integration systems are easier to maintain. The simple and elegant methodology results in clean design.
        integrationLabs is an extremely versatile. It abstracts the underlying technology. Allowing a mix of programming languages, platforms and protocols to exits. This style of legacy leverage again reduces TOC and time to production. Implementation costs and infrastructure expenses are kept to a minimum.
        integrationLabs object-oriented paradigm is the most powerful and easy to use of any integration framework. It creates dynamic, resilient circuitry whose behavior can be adapted at run-time. This allows for unobtrusive releases and seamless integration. Again powerful simplicity allows for rapid development of more complex integration systems. 
    Portability
        integrationLabs is available on an incredibly wide range of hardware and software platforms. This includes the usual suspects: Sun, Intel, IBM, Microsoft Windows variants, Macintosh OS variants and all Unices. However, integrationLabs has also found its way into a wide range of less well-known platforms, including PDAs and set-top boxes.
        By abstracting the technology, integrationLabs plays well with all programming languages. integrationLabs systems can be extended using C, C++, Java, python, erlang, scheme, etc! It can also be embedded in programs written in these languages.
        integrationLabs comes with the usual barrage of adapters which support almost all standards, fix, swift, CORBA, COM, SOAP, XML, XML-RPC and so on. Due to the simple design, integrationLabs works well with other third-party adapters.
        integrationLabs provides the option for integration with low-level APIs for both the Windows and Unix platforms, allowing applications to be highly platform compatible.
